- 👋 Hi, I’m Thomas Carlin. I'm based in New Zealand, currently working at Scion (Christchurch).
- 👀 I’m interested in developing models for species distributions, niche shifts, and population dynamics.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python to help analyse large datasets quickly.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on global ecological problems, particularly those related to conservation or invasive species.
- 📫 You can reach me at tom.carlin@scionresearch.com or t.carlin@live.co.uk
